Included in this features.zip archive are shapefiles of
Undersea Feature Names and their geometries for geospatial applications
These data were generated by the General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans (GEBCO)
Gazetteer of Undersea Feature Names

http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/gazetteer

Each shapefile is a set of four files ending in the extensions
'.dbf', '.prj', 'shp' and 'shx'.

Separate sets of shapefiles are provided based on geometry
type, since GIS programs require a single type of
geometry per shapefile.All shapefiles are named "features-"
with the geometry type appended.These types may be

  * point
  * linestring
  * polygon
  * multipoint
  * multilinestring
  * multipolygon

More information about the shapefile standard is online in
